This repository represents my submission for the Brainstorm Force front-end developer technical assessment. I invested a significant amount of effort and time into this project, and I am pleased with the final result. While I initially encountered challenges with certain unfamiliar concepts, I took the initiative to engage in extensive research and thoroughly explore documentation to overcome these hurdles.

Throughout the development process, I aimed to create a polished and well-structured solution that aligns with the assessment's requirements. This experience has further solidified my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. I'm excited about the opportunity to showcase my capabilities and contribute to the team at Brainstorm Force.

Thank you for considering my submission, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss and elaborate on the choices I made during the development of this assessment.
